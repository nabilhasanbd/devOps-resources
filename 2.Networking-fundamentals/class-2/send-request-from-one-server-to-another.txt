Here we will create two nginx server in docker and then we will send request from one server/container to another/container.

1. create two server
	$ docker run --name=web1 --rm nginx
	$ docker run --name=web2 --rm nginx
	
	Note: this two must be opened in different tab and running

2. Enter into web1
	$ docker exec -it web1 bash
	$ exit (not necessary just to exit)
	
3. To see in details 
	$ docker inspect web1 | grep -i ip 
	
4. Enter into web2 
	$ docker exec -it web2 bash

5. install listerners
	$ apt update
	$ apt install tcpdump
	$ curl localhost:80/google.com ( to check if it is working or not)
	$ ip link ( Lists all network interfaces available in the container, along with some status information about each one)
	$ apt install iproute2 
	Note : iproute2 a collection of utilities for controlling TCP/IP networking and traffic control in Linux
	$ ip link
	$ ip addr (Shows detailed information about all network interfaces, including their IP addresses)
	$ tcpdump -v -i eth0 tcp port 80
	Note : Starts capturing and displaying packets passing through the eth0 interface on TCP port 80,
	which is the default port for HTTP traffic.
	The -v flag increases the verbosity of the output to provide more detailed information.
