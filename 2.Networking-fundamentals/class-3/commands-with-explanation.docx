Linux Network Stack

In Linux networking, within the Linux network stack, routes define traffic paths, iptables configures packet filtering, lo is a local 
loopback interface for testing, and eth0 is the primary Ethernet interface for external connections. Let's inspect the network stack, in short.

Network interfaces allow us to establish communication between a network and a device.

ip link list
A route in networking specifies the path for network traffic from source to destination. View the routing table:

ip route show
iptables is a user-space utility for configuring packet filter rules in the Linux kernel's Netfilter framework. View iptables rules:

iptables -L
Create Custom Network Namespace
Let's create a custom namespace using ip netns add utiliy.

sudo ip netns add ryuzaki
sudo ip netns list
Now, to enter a network namespace in Linux:

ip netns exec is part of the iproute2 package and is often used for managing network namespaces.

sudo ip netns exec ryuzaki bash
nsenter

The nsenter utility is aslo commonly used to enter into namespaces in Linux, including network namespaces.

sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/ryuzaki bash
Now, to check the network interfaces inside the new ns.

ip link show
To check for iptable rules for custom ns.

ifconfig lo
